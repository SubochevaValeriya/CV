# üí¨ About me

<!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/progfay/shields-with-icon/master/README.md -->

I received a bachelor's degree in finance, after that I worked for three years in Financial Department of a bank, going from an intern to a manager. Over time I realized that it would be more interesting for me to develop in the IT field, I entered the master's program at the relevant faculty. Among the programming languages, I was especially attracted to Golang, which I liked for its clarity and capabilities.

Now I try to develop in the chosen direction: courses, books, articles, pet-projects, algorithmic problems, and so on. I am very inspired by writing code or solving challenging task, and I would really like to transfer this feeling from a hobby/study to a full-time job.

My past work experience has helped me develop the skills to learn quickly, work under tight deadlines, work in a team, find and fix bugs and help to improve my level of English. My daily programming training opens up something new for me every day, whether it's experience with various tools, libraries, the basics of building applications or approaches to writing code. I hope I can apply my hard and soft skills while working in a team on real tasks.
